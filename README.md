# How To Use
Create a custom search engine with any name and set the search string URL to:<br>
`https://example.com/?s=%s`

Set this as the default search engine and search away! It will redirect requests to Brave Search, where the full URL will show instead of the search terms.

* The request to example.com will be blocked before it goes through and no connection will be made.
